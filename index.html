    <h3>The Central Pennsylvania Open Source Conference (CPOSC) is a one-day 
        technical conference for open source users and developers. 
        Presentations and sessions cover all aspects of open source, 
        with talks ranging from novice to expert skill levels and featuring
         case studies, best practices, code-alongs and more. Join us for a day of 
         meeting with and learning from your technology peers.</h3>

<section class="Why">
    <h3>Why CPOSC?</h3>
    <p>Technology is evolving with unprecedented speed, 
        which means it's more important than ever for those on the front lines 
        of tech to gather, converse and share their experiences. 
        CPOSC offers technologists passionate about open source technologies 
        that very opportunity through presentations, panel discussions, 
        lightning talks, informal designated conversation topic areas, 
        and more.</p>

<section class="Downtown">
    <h3>Why Downtown Lancaster?</h3>
    <p>As Downtown Lancaster's arts, music, 
        and dining scenes have garnered national recognition over the past decade, 
        we firmly believe that the Lancaster tech scene is in the midst of its own 
        big boom. By moving downtown beginning in 2016, we wanted CPOSC to be at the 
        center of this tech explosion. As a bonus, it's an easy walk from the 
        Ware Center to the CPOSC After Party at Tellus360!</p>

<section class="expect">
    <h3>What to expect:</h3>
    <p>Since its start, CPOSC has featured experienced technologists speaking on a variety 
        of open source topics, from introduction level to deep dives and from emerging technologies 
        to those tried-and-tested. You can also find stories of lessons learned with OSS, as well as 
        niche industries like open source hardware. There is something for everyone at CPOSC.</p>
